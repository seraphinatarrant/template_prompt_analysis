citeproc-py is a `CSL`_ processor for Python. It aims to implement the
`CSL 1.0.1 specification`_. citeproc-py can output styled citations and
bibliographies in a number of different output formats. Currently
supported are plain text, reStructuredText and HTML. Other formats can
be added easily.

citeproc-py uses `semantic versioning`_. Currently, its major version
number is still at 0, meaning the API is not yet stable. However, you
should not expect to see any major API changes soon.

.. _CSL: http://citationstyles.org/
.. _CSL 1.0.1 specification: https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0.1/specification.html
.. _semantic versioning: http://semver.org/


Requirements
------------

citeproc-py supports Python 3.6 and up. It depends on `lxml`_ for parsing and
navigating the CSL style and locale files.

.. _lxml: http://lxml.de/


Installation
------------

The recommended way of installing citeproc-py is by using `pip`_::

   pip install citeproc-py

If lxml isn't installed, pip will try to install it for you.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/

If you insist, you can manually install citeproc-py from distribution packages
hosted at `PyPI`_. Please ignore the release archives offered by GitHub.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citeproc-py/


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with citeproc-py, take a look at the examples under
``examples/``. Two examples are provided, one parsing references from a
JSON representation of references as supported by citeproc-js, another
parsing the references from a BibTeX file. Both show and explain how to
cite references and render the bibliography.


CSL Compatibility
-----------------

Currently, citeproc-py passes almost 60% of the (relevant) tests in the
`citeproc-test suite`_. However, it is more than 60% complete, as
citeproc-py doesn't take care of double spaces and repeated punctuation
marks yet, making a good deal of the tests fail. In addition, the
following features have not yet been implemented (there are probably
some I forgot though):

-  disambiguation/year-suffix
-  et-al-subsequent-min/et-al-subsequent-use-first
-  collapsing
-  punctuation-in-quote
-  display

Also, some `citeproc-js`_ functionality that is not part of the CSL spec
is not (yet) supported:

-  raw dates
-  static-ordering
-  literal names

.. _citeproc-js: https://github.com/juris-m/citeproc-js


Running the Tests
-----------------

First clone the `citeproc-test suite`_ so that it sits next to the
citeproc-py directory. Now you can run ``citeproc-test.py`` (in the ``tests``
directory). Run ``citeproc-test.py --help`` to see its usage information.
